# CarpentriesLab Lesson Proposals

Thank you for your interest in the The CarpentriesLab! This repository is used to track the lessons that are aimed to be reviewed by our community. Our reviews are open, and their goal is to ensure that the lessons follow best practices in pedagogy and the general teaching approach that have been tried in Carpentries workshops.

Everyone participating in CarpentriesLab agrees to follow The Carpentries Code of Conduct.

## Why CarpentriesLab?

There is excitement and interest in the way The Carpentries teach and deliver workshops. We are developing tools and templates for lessons that have proven to be effective to format and deliver both in workshop settings and in self-guided.

There is also a need from learners who have participated in our workshops to explore further topics that can only just be covered briefly in our 2-day trainings.

The goal of CarpentriesLab is to be a repository of high-quality, community-reviewed, discoverable lessons. People already familiar with Carpentries teaching practice can pick them up and teach them in meetups, in class, or in complement of a "standard" Carpentries 2-day workshop. The lessons should also be designed such that learners can also go through them on their own.
