# The Carpentries Lab

Thank you for your interest in The Carpentries Lab! This repository is used to track the lessons that are aimed to be reviewed by our 
community. Our reviews are open, and their goal is to ensure that the lessons follow best practices in pedagogy and the general teaching practices 
used in Carpentries workshops.

Everyone participating in The Carpentries Lab agrees to follow The Carpentries [Code of Conduct][coc].

## Why The Carpentries Lab?

There is excitement and interest in the way The Carpentries teach and deliver workshops. We are developing tools and templates for lessons that have proven to be effective to format and deliver both in workshop settings and for self-guided learning.

There is also a need from learners who have participated in our workshops to explore further topics that can only be covered briefly in our 2-day trainings.

The goal of The Carpentries Lab is to be a repository of high-quality, community-reviewed, discoverable lessons. People already familiar with The Carpentries teaching practice can pick them up and teach them in meetups, in class, or in complement of a "standard" Carpentries 2-day workshop. The lessons can also be used by independent learners, outside of workshops.

## The Carpentries Lab vs The Carpentries Incubator

* Collaborative lesson development
