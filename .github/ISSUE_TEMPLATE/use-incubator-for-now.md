Thank you for your interest in the Carpentries Lab. In the near future, this repository will accept proposals for lessons to be reviewed by The Carpentries community. **However, we are not quite ready to accept unsolicited proposals.**

In the meantime, we have set up _The Carpentries Incubator_ as a place to share and develop community-contributed lessons. Please go to https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/issues/new to request a repository where you can develop and share your lessons with other community members.

If you have any questions, please send us an email at team@carpentries.org.
