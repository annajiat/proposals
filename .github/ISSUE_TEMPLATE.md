Thank you for your interest in the Carpentries Lab. In the near future, this repository will accept proposals for lessons to be reviewed by The Carpentries community. However, we are not quite ready to accept unsolicited proposals. In the meantime, we have set up The Carpentries Incubator as a place to share and develop community-contributed lessons. Please go to https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/issues/new to request a repository where you can develop and share your lessons with other community members. If you have any questions, please send us an email at team@carpentries.org.
